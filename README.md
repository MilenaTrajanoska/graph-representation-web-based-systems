## Introduction

This repository provides a structured approach to understanding and implementing graph representation learning techniques, emphasizing practical applications in web-based contexts.

## Lectures

Each topic is presented in a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) for an interactive learning experience, covering both theoretical concepts and practical implementations.

### Knowledge Graph Basics
- **Overview:** Introduction to graph theory and key concepts like nodes, edges, and adjacency matrices.
- **Applications:** Understanding the fundamental structures that form the basis of web-based networks and other graph data structures.

## Setup

To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MilenaTrajanoska/graph-representation-web-based-systems.git
cd graph-representation-web-based-systems
```

### Optional: Creating a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
